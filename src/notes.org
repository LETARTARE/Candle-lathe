* font too small (at least on screen size at 1920x1080)
* jog button a bit small
* ideally with a scalable screen layout and svg icons for tablet

* 20210904 re-arrnage layout for small touch screen
** main page show 3D view and some basic control buttons
   jog, set X as (display both radius and diameter), set Z as, Run
   open file is handled by menu, not pretty, but ok
** after Run is clicked, should hide/disable Jog/Set-X/Z button, and only Pause and STOP 
   perhaps speed over-ride (feed and rapid), but ok to leave it on a separate tab
** also want to display elapsed time and estimated time
   TODO: estimated time is not very accurate (perhaps not considering accellration and x/z speed difference)
** may want to display DRO/RPM on main page, but not critical
   ezNC shows this already
** TODOS
*** better icons for Jog/Run/Stop

* 20200909 serial port problem (seems fixed]
  happens 1st with rpi3 and ezNC, eventually happened on labtop,
  enable echo and post process log (cat foo.log | ./proc.pl | grep ERROR)
  found a lot more discrepencies, but only few will show up as error
** err on rpi3, happens often
*** no missed char, wrong order ?
G1 X0.341 Y0.000 Z0.336    echo: G10.X341Y0.000Z0.36
G1 X2.600 Y0.000 Z-0.776   echo: G12.6X00Y0.000Z-0.776
*** totally wrong
G1 X0.941 Y0.000 Z0.260    echo  G10.8X00Y0.000Z0.118 ? (err is on previous line, but echoed empty)

** also happens on laptop

** no problem with uno, esp32 seemed ok, only happens with ezNC 
   move serial port task from core #0 to #1 seems fixed the problem
