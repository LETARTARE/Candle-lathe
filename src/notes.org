* font too small (at least on screen size at 1920x1080)
* jog button a bit small
* ideally with a scalable screen layout and svg icons for tablet

* 20210904  re-arrnage layout for small touch screen
** main page show 3D view and some basic control buttons
   jog, set X as (display both radius and diameter), set Z as, Run
   open file is handled by menu, not pretty, but ok
** after Run is clicked, should hide/disable Jog/Set-X/Z button, and only Pause and STOP 
   perhaps speed over-ride (feed and rapid), but ok to leave it on a separate tab
** also want to display elapsed time and estimated time
   TODO: estimated time is not very accurate (perhaps not considering accellration and x/z speed difference)
** may want to display DRO/RPM on main page, but not critical
   ezNC shows this already
** TODOS
*** better icons for Jog/Run/Stop
